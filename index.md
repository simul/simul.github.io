trueSKY
==============
trueSKY is a software development kit that allows realistic skies, clouds and atmospheric effects to be rendered in real time on a variety of platforms. From the culmination of many years of research and development, it is based on physical principles of light scattering and absorption, and is highly optimized for speed. We believe it is the best-performing system for realistic, real-time skies and clouds.

In this documentation you will find everything you need to start producing high quality skies.
