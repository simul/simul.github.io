<div class="textblock"><p>The Sky Sequencer is a tool for artists, technical artists, level designers, and mission planners. It also helps programmers to understand the workings of True Sky's sky, clouds and time-of-day systems.</p>
<p>To launch the Sequencer, go to Start Menu/All Programs/Simul/Sky Sequencer/Sky Sequencer.</p>
<h1>The Sequencer Window </h1>
<h2>The Timeline </h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Timeline.png" alt="Timeline.png"/>
</div>
<p>To change the current time, drag the red vertical line (the time marker) by its handle. To change the visible time-window, drag the timeline at the bottom. To adjust the range of visible time, use the mousewheel to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>To select keyframes, either click on a single keyframe, shift-click to select multiple keyframes, or box-select them. When one or more keyframes are selected, their properties can be changed in the property box. Changing any property affects all selected keyframes of the appropriate type (e.g. all cloud keyframes, or all sky keyframes.) </p><div class="image">
<img src="SkyKeyframeSelect.png" alt="SkyKeyframeSelect.png"/>
</div>
<p>To select a whole row of keyframes, double-click on the space in-between them. </p><div class="image">
<img src="SkyKeyframesSelect.png" alt="SkyKeyframesSelect.png"/>
</div>
<p>To select a layer (the sky, a layer of clouds, etc.), click on its name in the column on the left of the timeline. </p><div class="image">
<img src="SkyLayerSelect.png" alt="SkyLayerSelect.png"/>
</div>
<p>To add a keyframe, right-click on the timeline and select the "Add sky 
keyframe..." or "Add cloud keyframe..." option.</p>
<p>Sky keyframes determine the colours of the sky from horizon to zenith, any haze effect, and light colour.</p>
<p>Cloud keyframes determine the properties of the cloud layer at a given time. As the light direction changes with time of day, it is necessary to have enough cloud keyframes to reflect the lighting throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Map Window </h2>
<p>This window shows the cloud keyframes in a plan view. Wind heading and speed affects the position of each keyframe - or they can be positioned individually. The camera is shown as a red line indicating its direction of view. Rain regions are shown as filled grey circles (blue when highlighted).</p>
<h2>Properties Window </h2>
<p>The Properties Window can be activated from the Window&gt;&gt;Properties menu option. Whatever is selected in the timeline can be edited in the properties window. Its contents depend on the current selection.</p>
<p>When nothing is selected (click on a blank part of the timeline), the general properties are shown, including camera and view properties.</p>
<h2>Performance Window </h2>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<td><p class="starttd">The Performance Window can be activated from the Window&gt;&gt;Performance menu option. When active, this window shows a text display of GPU and CPU profiling data for trueSKY. The GPU data is taken from the DirectX11 view.</p>
<p>The values are shown in a hierarchical tree - the time for each element includes the times of its children. The numbers given are times in milliseconds. The colour of the text for each item indicates what percentage of its parent time it occupies. The more red the text, the larger its contribution.</p>
<p class="endtd">You'll see a slight pause in the Sequencer about once per second as the performance window updates - this doesn't affect the measurements.  </p>

<h1>Features </h1>
<h2>Presets </h2>
<div class="image">
<img src="Presets.png" alt="Presets.png"/>
</div>
<p>The Sky and Clouds (both 2D and 3D) have various presets available, to quickly set a keyframe to a specific arrangement of values, designed to simulate the desired outcome. Be this a specific type of cloud or just a clear sky. The available presets are, for the Sky: Clear Sky and Fog, for 2D Clouds: Cirrus, Cirrocumulus and Altocumulus and for 3D Clouds: Cumulonimbus, Cumulus, Stratus, Stratocumulus and Altocumulus.</p>
<h2>Clouds </h2>
<p>In the sequencer, clouds can be edited in two ways. Clicking (or shift-clicking) individual keyframes will allow the properties for one or more keyframes at any point in time to be altered. Alternatively, clicking the 2D Clouds or 3D Clouds column will allow the properties for the respective cloud layer to be altered. Cloud layer properties will impact the entire sequence indefinitely, allowing you to enable/disable cloud rendering, alter the speed of rainfall, change the render mode and more. Whereas keyframe properties are temporal, allowing you to alter cloudiness, rain strength, wind speed and so on, for the point in time at which the keyframe is active. Note: If just a single keyframe is present in the sequencer, then those settings will be applied continously.</p>
<h3>Cloud Layer Properties</h3>
<p>Note that for 2D clouds, there is no Precipitation section. The cloud layer properties accessible in the sequencer are:</p>

<h2>The Sky</h2>
<p>In the sequencer, just as with clouds, the sky can be edited in two ways. Clicking (or shift-clicking) individual keyframes will allow the properties for one or more keyframes at any point in time to be altered. Alternatively, clicking the Sky column will allow the properties for the sky layer to be altered. These properties will impact the entire sequence indefinitely, allowing you to adjust the amount of ozone, alter the diameter of the sun/moon, set the start date of the scene and more. Whereas keyframe properties are temporal, allowing you to adjust settings like visibility, haze, eccentricity and so on, for the point in time at which the keyframe is active. Note: If just a single keyframe is present in the sequencer, then those settings will be applied continously.</p>
<h3>Brightness Power</h3>
<p>The sky at sunrise can be less than one quarter as bright as at noon. Moonlight is hundreds of times dimmer than sunlight. Starlight is much dimmer still. The human eye adjusts to a very wide range of light conditions, but for rendering we usually apply a brightness, or exposure level, to make dark scenes visible and bright scenes clear.<br />
 The Brightness Power value for a sky sequence adjusts the light levels to compensate for this large variation by introducing a power function. If the Power is 1.0, there is no adjustment. If it is 0.5, it will be a square-root dependence, e.g. a light 4 times dimmer than daylight would appear only half as dim, and so on.</p>
<h3>Automatic Sun and Moon Positions</h3>
<p>If these options are enabled, the sun and/or moon can be automatically placed in the sky based on the time, day, month and year. Otherwise, each sky keyframe will have manual position settings.</p>
<h3>Colour Sky</h3>
<p>A colour sky has colours for sky and fade determined by a choice from a colour dialog. The default behaviour (non-colour sky) is to generate the colours from physical properties). </p>
<h3>Sky Layer Properties</h3>
<p>Sky layer properties are more general, and will affect all sky keyframes. The sky layer properties accessible in the sequencer are:</p>
