Programming with the trueSKY SDK
================================

The SDK comes as a set of libraries, under a main "Simul" directory. These can be linked statically or dynamically, depending on the platform. CMake is used to build the binaries, which are found by default in "Simul/build/lib" in the case of static libraries, and "Simul/build/bin" for dll's. Source is found in the subdirectories for the constituent libraries.

Namespace generally corresponds to the source file location. For example, simul::clouds::CloudRenderer is found in "Simul/Clouds/CloudRenderer.h".

The compiled Windows libraries are in two runtime versions, MD and MT. The runtime is the set of libraries provided by Microsoft that provides basic system functions.
You should generally use the same runtime all the way through a project, although different runtimes can be used for DLL's, because they are self-contained.

For Windows, the Debug and Release configurations are supplied as DLL's linked against the dynamic, MD runtime.
The Static Debug and Static Release configuratons are supplied as static libraries linked against the static, MT runtime.

On other platforms, the default runtime and linkage is used.
