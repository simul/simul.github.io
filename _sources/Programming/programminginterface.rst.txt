Plugin Rendering Interface
======================================

One way to connect trueSKY to a game or simulation engine is using the Plugin Rendering Interface.
A dynamic link library or dll called TrueSkyPluginRenderer_MT.dll (or similar) is loaded, dynamically, from within the game engine.
The exported functions are used to perform sky rendering per-frame for each view.

A reference to the relevant functions can be found :doc:`here. <../Reference/plugin>`
