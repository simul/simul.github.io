Updating
--------
Two instances of CloudKeyframer are stored in simul::clouds::Environment - one for 3D volumetric clouds and one for 2D high-altitude clouds.
As a keyframer, this class stores a list of keyframes; this list can be modified at runtime, or loaded from a sequence (see Unresolved reference man_6_sequencer).
