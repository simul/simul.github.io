<p>Subject to your compliance with all the terms of this Agreement, Simul grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this Agreement) Licence to use the Licensed Product (the “Licence”).</p>
<p>The Licence becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the trueSKY Plugin. The Licence does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed Product.</p>
<p>You may only Distribute the Licensed Product as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Distribution to End Users - You may Distribute the Licensed Product incorporated in Object Code format only as an inseparable part of an Integrated Product to end users who are subject to an end user Licence agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed Product. The Integrated Product may not contain any Source Code or Editor Libraries. The total final cost of development of the Integrated Product must be less than £100000, regardless of the number of Users or Licences contributing to its development.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution to other Licensees - You may Distribute trueSKY Code (including as modified by you under the Licence) in Source Code or Object Code format, or any Content, to a Licensee who has rights under its Licence to the same Version of the trueSKY Plugin that you are Distributing.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributions to employees and contractors - You also may Distribute Content to a Licensee who is your employee or your contractor who does not have rights under their Licence to the same Content, but only to permit that Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop an Integrated Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the Licence, and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited Licence to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may not sublicense the Licensed Product in Source Code format. You may not sublicense the Licensed Product in Object Code format, or any Content, except to grant end users the ability to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, an Integrated Product that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. This paragraph does not limit your rights to Distribute and sublicense Examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-licence">
<h2>2. User Licence<a class="headerlink" href="#user-licence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Licensed Product is Licensed to you for use by a single User. The User may store the Licensed Product on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Product cannot be shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted Distribution as described above. No more than one instance of the Licensed Product may be used for each Licence (per-seat licence).</p>
<p>In order to access and download the trueSKY Plugin, you must set up an Account. You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your Account.</p>
<p>Under the Licence, the User may use the Licensed Product for as long as you comply with this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to “you” in this agreement also apply to the User in all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.</p>

However, any Versions of the trueSKY Plugin that Simul has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this Agreement as described in Section 22, are considered part of the Licensed Product and may be used under the Licence (as amended by that amendment).</p>

<h2>10. Third Party Software<a class="headerlink" href="#third-party-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Editor Libraries include Third Party Software components. If Third Party Software has separate software Licence or attribution requirements, the Licence terms or other attribution requirements for Third Party Software components can be found in the installation directory for each engine version (under the /Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licences sub-folder). By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those Licences. In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the Licence for the Third Party Software. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.</p>

<div class="section" id="ownership">
<h2>11. Ownership<a class="headerlink" href="#ownership" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express Licence only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement. No Licence or other rights will be created hereunder by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any attempted sublicense under this Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.</p>

<h2>14. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability<a class="headerlink" href="#disclaimers-and-limitation-of-liability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Simul’s total liability under this agreement, if any, for any damages suffered by any party (including any end user), whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be limited to direct damages and shall not exceed the amount of fees paid to Simul by you pursuant to this agreement. The licence fee charged under this agreement is a consideration in limiting Simul’s liability hereunder. You agree that under no circumstances shall Simul be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages suffered by any party resulting from or arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>
<p>To the full extent permitted by law, Simul shall not be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Licensed Product or otherwise in connection with this Agreement.

<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Term of the Licence. This Agreement will continue in effect unless terminated as described below.</p></li>
<li><p>Termination by Simul. Simul may terminate the Agreement by providing written notice if you materially breach any provision of this Agreement and the breach is not curable or, if it is curable, you fail to cure the breach within thirty (30) days of notice of the breach from Simul. Without limiting the foregoing, your failure to make any payment due under this Agreement or breach of any restriction under the Simul Licences constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Termination for Patent Action. The Agreement will terminate automatically as of the date you commence any claim that the Licensed Product infringes a patent, or otherwise support any claim by a third party that the Licensed Product infringes a patent.</p></li>
<li><p>Effect of Termination. Upon any termination, the Simul Licences will automatically terminate, you may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to you by the Simul Licences, and you must destroy all copies of the Licensed Product in your possession and cease distributing any Products developed under this Agreement.

</ol>
<p>Sections 5-7, 9-11, 13-15, 17-19, and 23-27 will survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="18">
<li><p>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This Agreement is construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. All parties attorn to the jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="21">
<li><p>Independent Contractor</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You and Simul are independent contractors and this Agreement will not be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between you and Simul. Neither party has any right or authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representation or warranty on behalf of the other party.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="22">
<li><p>Amendments of this Agreement</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Simul may issue an amended Agreement at any time in its discretion by providing notice to you or by providing you with digital access to the amended Agreement when you next log in to your Account, or download additional Content or new Versions. You are not required to accept the amended Agreement. However, in order to continue accessing your Account or to download or use additional Content or new Versions, you must accept the amended Agreement. By logging in to your Account, or downloading or using additional Content or a new Version, you hereby agree to be bound by the amended Agreement then most recently issued by Simul. If you do not accept the amended Agreement, you may not log in to your Account, download or use additional Content, or download or use any new Version that is made available by Simul contemporaneously with or after the issuance of that amended Agreement. This will not terminate your Licence for the Licensed Product that you downloaded prior to the issuance of the amended Agreement. If you are an organization, acceptance of an amended Agreement by any of your Users will be binding on you.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="23">
<li><p>Notices</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where this Agreement calls for notice from Simul, including written notice, Simul may provide notice to you at the email address that you provided when you registered for the Licence (or any updated email address you subsequently provide). Simul’s notices to you will be effective when they are sent to that email address.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="24">
<li><p>No Assignment</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may not, without the prior written consent of Simul, assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, and any attempt without that consent will be null and void. You also may not transfer your Account. Simul may at any time assign, transfer, charge, or sub-contract all or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement. For clarity, you are not prohibited by Simul from assigning or transferring your rights in your Product, other than the trueSKY Code, Content, and Contributions. Third Party Software assignment and transfer is governed by the terms of the applicable Licences.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="26">
<li><p>Miscellaneous</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This Agreement and any document or information referred to in this Agreement constitute the entire agreement between you and Simul relating to the subject matter covered by this Agreement. All other communications, proposals, and representations with respect to the subject matter covered by this Agreement are excluded.</p>
<p>This Agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your jurisdiction. This Agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of your jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. Limitations and exclusions of warranties and remedies in this Agreement may not apply to you because your jurisdiction may not allow them in your particular circumstance. In the event that certain provisions of this Agreement are not enforceable in your jurisdiction, those provisions shall be enforceable to the furthest extent possible under applicable law.</p>
<p>Any act by Simul to exercise, or failure or delay in exercise of, any of its rights under this Agreement, at law or in equity will not be deemed a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies available.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, if any term of this Agreement is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. You agree that this Agreement does not confer any rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this Agreement, except as expressly stated.</p>
