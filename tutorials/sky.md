Sky
====================

In trueSKY, the sky is modified in two ways: through sky keyframes and the sky layer. Keyframe properties will dictate the look of the sky at a given point in time - with interpolation used to derive properties at times between keyframes -- whereas layer properties will be active throughout a sequence. Both can be modified via the sequencer or through the Blueprint system.

Fog
=============

A keyframe's haze value determines how much Mie-scattered haze (i.e. mist or fog) is present. Haze is considered to have a density that falls-off exponentially with altitude, so the HazeScaleHeightKm property determines the scaling height for this exponential. TheHazeBaseHeightKm is also used. Below this height, full haze is applied.

Link keyframe time and daytime
---------------
The SkyKeyframer has two modes of operation. By switching <a href="../ref/simul/sky/skykeyframer/setlinkkeyframetimeanddaytime.html">LinkKeyframeTimeAndDaytime</a>on or off,
you can choose whether the keyframes have a daytime value which is independent of time, or whether these two numbers are the same.

If they are linked, <a href="../ref/simul/sky/basekeyframe/time.html">time</a>and <a href="../ref/simul/sky/skykeyframe/daytime.html">daytime </a>
will be the same number, where 0 represents the first midnight of the sequence, 1.0 represents 24 hours after this, and so on.




Linked Time and Daytime
-----------------------


![](/Images/SkyKeyframerLinked.png)


Here we enable this link by calling SetLinkKeyframeTimeAndDaytime, then verify that daytime and time are now the same:

simul::sky::SkyKeyframer *sk=environment->skyKeyframer;
sk->SetLinkKeyframeTimeAndDaytime(true);
for(int i=0;i<sk->GetNumKeyframes();i++)
{
simul::sky::SkyKeyframe *k=(simul::sky::SkyKeyframe *)sk->GetKeyframe(i);
assert(k->daytime==k->time);
}


Unlinked Time and Daytime
-------------------------

If they are not linked, then while daytime is defined as above, the keyframe's <a href="../ref/simul/sky/basekeyframe/time.html">time</a>
value is arbitrary - it could represent the real time in seconds, or some other scale. Furthermore, while the keyframes
will be sorted so that they are in ascending order of <a href="../ref/simul/sky/basekeyframe/time.html">time</a>,
daytime will have no such restriction. You could have a midday keyframe, followed by sunset, followed by midday again.
Here, we set all the keyframes to be at daytime=0.25 (6am):

simul::sky::SkyKeyframer *sk=environment->skyKeyframer.Get();
sk->SetLinkKeyframeTimeAndDaytime(false);
for(int i=0;i<sk->GetNumKeyframes();i++)
{
simul::sky::SkyKeyframe *k=(simul::sky::SkyKeyframe *)sk->GetKeyframe(i);
k->daytime=0.25f;
}

You could also disable <a href="../ref/simul/sky/skykeyframe/automaticsunposition.html">automaticSunPosition</a>, in which case daytime will have no effect
on sun position.

The unlinked time mode is particularly suitable to situations where you will use the Simul API to change conditions on the fly.
At any given time, two keyframes are being used for rendering, and the next one along will be partially updated. So the properties
of the fourth keyframe can be changed without having any need for recalculations.

simul::sky::SkyKeyframe *k=environment->skyKeyframer->GetNextModifiableKeyframe();
k->haze=20.f;

This works just as well with linked as with unlinked times.
