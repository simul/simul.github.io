Cloud volumes allow you to place specific formations of clouds in the sky. These volumes can be customised just like any other clouds, and multiple can be created, allowing you to create your own skylines! 

To create a volume, simply right click within the cloud layer and select "Add new Volume"

This will turn this layer into a volume layer, meaning this layer will only use volumes, not a repeating skyline. If you still want a repeating sky as well, simply create another layer.

There are two modes of editing in the Cloud Window - Keyframe and Volume. In Keyframe mode, you can drag the whole layer around, along with any volumes in the scene. 

Double click to switch between the editing modes. In Volume edit mode, you can individually move and adjust each volume in your layer. You must have a volume present to enter Volume Edit mode. To move them, click and drag from the volume centre. You should see the change in your scene as you move it. This is done for each keyframe, similar to an animation track. Select your keyframe, then adjust the values for that time. Next, create a new keyframe, select it, and adjust values for that time. Now, the values will seamlessly interpolate between each other as time passes.

Currently, we can create circular shapes. The size of these circles can be altered through the Cloud Window by extending the bounds of the circle.  These circles act as a cylinder in the scene. Grab the right handle to adjust the upper face of the cylinder, or the left handle for the lower face. You can then adjust the height with the centre handle. You can create all sorts of shapes by just adjusting these values. 

If you want to adjust the base height of the volume, use the Cloudbase in the Cloud keyframe settings. This means all clouds in one layer start at the same height. Add multiple layers if you want multiple volumes at alternating heights.
