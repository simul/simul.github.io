Clouds
====================
To get the most out of trueSKY clouds, learning how the different variables work together is important. Below you will find a description of each different variable, along with some recommended values. If you would rather watch a tutorial video, head over to [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/simulsoftware) for examples, walkthroughs and tips.

* [**Variables**](variables.html)                                                       - Details of all the different variables for clouds

* [**Volumes**](volumes.html)                                                           - Learn about Cloud Volumes



Clouds are the leading feature of trueSKY, allowing for real time volumetric clouds to be added seamlessly into any level. This tutorial is about editing the clouds through the use of the Sky Sequencer. A tutorial on the Sky Sequencer can be found [here](sequencer.html). Alternatively, see [Editing with Unity Scripting](/unity/scripting) or [Using UE4 Blueprint](/unreal/blueprints) for engine specific editing.
