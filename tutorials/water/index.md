trueWATER
====================

Clouds are the leading feature of trueSKY, allowing for real time volumetric clouds to be added seamlessly into any level. This tutorial is about editing the clouds through the use of the Sky Sequencer. A tutorial on the Sky Sequencer can be found [here](/tutorials/sequencer). Alternatively, see [Editing with Unity Scripting](/unity/scripting) or [Using UE4 Blueprint](/unreal/blueprints.html) for engine specific editing.
