Sky
====================
In trueSKY, the sky is modified in two ways: through sky keyframes and the sky layer. Keyframe properties will dictate the look of the sky at a given point in time - with interpolation used to derive properties at times between keyframes -- whereas layer properties will be active throughout a sequence. Both can be modified via the sequencer or through the Blueprint system.
