Rainbows
====================
Rainbows are automatically generated by trueSKY providing that a number of conditions are met.

Rainbow can be fully customised, from position to strength and colour of the rainbow.

Note: Both Rain Strength and Rain Streaks must be greated than 0 for rainbows to be generated.
