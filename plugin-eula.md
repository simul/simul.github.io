1. Licence Grant
----------------

Subject to your compliance with all the terms of this Agreement, Simul grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as described in this Agreement) Licence to use the Licensed Products (the "Licence").

The Licence becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the trueSKY Plugin. The Licence does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed Products.

(A) Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing

	You may only Distribute the Licensed Products as follows:

     a. Distribution to End Users - You may Distribute the Licensed Products incorporated in object code format only as an inseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end user Licence agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed Products. The Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in uncooked source format or any Engine Tools.

     b. Distribution to other Licensees - You may Distribute trueSKY Code (including as modified by you under the Licence) in Source Code or object code format, or any Content, to an Licensee who has rights under its Licence to the same Version of the trueSKY Plugin that you are Distributing.
	
     c. Distributions to employees and contractors - You also may Distribute Content (other than Paid Plug-ins) to an Licensee who is your employee or your contractor who does not have rights under their Licence to the same Content, but only to permit that Licensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the Licence, and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited Licence to use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined above, and for no other purpose.

You are permitted to post snippets of trueSKY Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet, or distribute such snippets in connection with supporting patches and plug-ins for the Licensed Products, so long as it is not for the purpose of enabling non-Licensees to use or modify any trueSKY Code, or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the trueSKY Code.

You may not subLicence the Licensed Products in Source Code format. You may not subLicence the Licensed Products in object code format, or any Content, except to grant end users the ability to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a Product that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. This paragraph does not limit your rights to Distribute and subLicence Examples.

(B) Other Restrictions

(i) UE-Only Content

For UE-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the Licence only if and to the extent that the UE-Only Content is utilized in combination with the trueSKY Code. For example, you may not develop or Distribute a Product that consists of or contains UE-Only Content but does not contain and require the trueSKY Code (including as modified by you under the Licence) for its use. The UE-Only Content is subject to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to Content, as well as the additional limitations described in this paragraph. All references in this paragraph to UE-Only Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the Licence.

(ii) Non-Compatible Licences

You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Products with any code or other content which is covered by a Licence that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Licensed Products be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement ("Non-Compatible Licence"). Code or content under the following Licences, for example, are prohibited: GNU General Public Licence (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Licence. Code or content under the following Licences, for example, are allowed: BSD Licence, MIT Licence, Microsoft Public Licence, or Apache Licence. You may not subLicence the Licensed Products under a Non-Compatible Licence.

(iii) General Restrictions

You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Products, including as incorporated into a Product for operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems or air traffic control machines, or for military use in connection with live combat.


2. User Licence
---------------

The Licensed Products is Licensed to you for use by a single User (other than Paid Plug-ins, which may also be used by your Paid Plug-in Users as described below). The User may store the Licensed Products on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Products cannot be shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted Distribution as described above. 

In order to access and download the trueSKY Plugin, you must set up an Account. You may not share or allow others to use your Account. You are responsible for the security of your Account.

Under the Licence, the User may use the Licensed Products for as long as you comply with this Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to "you" in this agreement also apply to the User in all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.
 
For Paid Plug-ins, in addition to use by a single User, each Paid Plug-in User with respect to whom you have paid the associated fee may store the Paid Plug-in on any of the Paid Plug-in User’s computers and may use the Paid Plug-in on your behalf under the Licence, but the Paid Plug-in cannot be otherwise shared with others except through a permitted Distribution as described above. You are responsible for each Paid Plug-in User’s compliance with this Agreement.

3. New Versions and Content
---------------------------

Simul may make available future Versions of the trueSKY Plugin. Simul does not have any obligation to make new Versions of the trueSKY Plugin available, or to ensure compatibility with any specific Engine Version. Nor does Simul have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all Versions of the trueSKY Plugin. However, any Versions of the trueSKY Plugin that Simul has made available to you, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this Agreement as described in Section 22, are considered part of the Licensed Products and may be used under the Licence (as amended by that amendment).

By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those Licences. In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the Licence for the Third Party Software. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software. 

11. Ownership
-------------

Any attempted subLicence under this Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

You agree that under no circumstances shall Simul be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages suffered by any party resulting from or arising out of or related to this Agreement.

To the full extent permitted by law, Simul shall not be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Licensed Products or otherwise in connection with this Agreement.

These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

15. Indemnity
-------------

You agree to indemnify and hold Simul, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, insurers, representatives, successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of or in connection with or resulting directly or indirectly from (a) any claim that any aspect of the Integrated Products (excluding any claim related to the Licensed Products) infringes any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right of a third party, and (b) any and all acts and omissions by you with respect to the Licensed Products or the Integrated Products, including, without limitation, any misrepresentation (whether intentional or otherwise) of Simul or the Licensed Products, the use, operation or possession of the Licensed Products by any Licensee or the Integrated Products by any End User, the marketing or support of the Integrated Products, or any breach of this Agreement by you.
