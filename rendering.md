All Simul's default renderers use a right-handed co-ordinate system with x pointing East, y North, and z up. All units of distance are metres or kilometres. If not specified as km, distance is in metres. Angular units are radians, unless specified as degrees. Temperature is in kelvins, unless specified as degrees Celsius.
